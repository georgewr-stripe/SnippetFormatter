# Snippet Formatter
This is a lightweight project to prettify code snippets for use in email / documents.

This project uses torchlight.dev for highlighting the syntax

Currently there is only a formatter/linter for Python and Javascript, it uses Black and Prettier in order to do this.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
